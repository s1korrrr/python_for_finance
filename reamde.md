In case you do not know:

Open - When the stock market opens in the morning for trading, what was the price of one share?
High - over the course of the trading day, what was the highest value for that day?
Low - over the course of the trading day, what was the lowest value for that day?
Close - When the trading day was over, what was the final price?
Volume - For that day, how many shares were traded?
Adj Close - This one is slightly more complicated, but, over time, companies may decide to do something
called a stock split. For example, Apple did one once their stock price exceeded $1000. Since in most cases,
people cannot buy fractions of shares, a stock price of $1,000 is fairly limiting to investors.
Companies can do a stock split where they say every share is now 2 shares, and the price is half.
Anyone who had 1 share of Apple for $1,000, after a split where Apple doubled the shares,
they would have 2 shares of Apple (AAPL), each worth $500. Adj Close is helpful,
since it accounts for future stock splits, and gives the relative price to splits. For this reason,
the adjusted prices are the prices you're most likely to be dealing with.
